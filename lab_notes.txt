Trying to get roslaunch to launch distributed nodes

Created boxbot machine file

Run roslaunch:
$ roslaunch distributed_roslaunch stompy_top.launch

got error:
"Incompatible ssh peer (no acceptable kex algorithm)"

	Appears to be a paramiko issue. Paramiko is the python
	library that Ubunto uses for ssh

	Version of paramiko that ships with Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't
	work with newer versions of ssh

	Fixed by upgrading paramiko: 
	sudo pip install paramiko --upgrade

	solution at: http://answers.ros.org/question/250262/incompatible-ssh-peer-when-launching-a-remote-node/

Next error:
remote[10.0.1.14-4]: env: /home/stompy/stompy/bbbStuff_dev/catkin_ws/src/distributed_roslaunch/src/env.sh: No such file or directory


Found this example of an env.sh file:
#!/bin/sh

export ROS_IP=192.168.0.20
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
export ROSLAUNCH_SSH_UNKNOWN=1
. /home/alberto/at_robot_ws/devel/setup.sh
exec "$@"

Figured out how to run commands in parallel over multiple ssh connections:
$ pssh -i -h ~/stompy-in-a-box_hosts.txt echo "hello"


Trying to get ssh keys on each remote pi, and set them up to auto ssh into head
That way I can pssh_stompybox and rsync to push out files

Perhaps a git repo would be a better way
